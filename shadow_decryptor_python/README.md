# shadowcrack
This program consists in crypt some passwords from a dictionary and after that compare them with the shadow file. It's my first program i expected that this is a good weapon for someone.
To use it, you only need to change xd.dic for your dictionary, and that's all. Use by your own risk.
For educational purposes.
Have Fun ;D
