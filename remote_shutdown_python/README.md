# remoteShutdown
Hello everyone ;D, this is my new "programm" it's a little bit simple, but very useful in my case. It consists in a remotely shutdown with a Computer or mobile, i don't know if even still works in tablets, but i supose it works. It have two sides, the server which is the "victim" and the cli side which send the command to server to shutdown, leave me comments or stars if you like it.
You can implement subprocess and after it hide in your computer. After computer boot start the programm, this would be a defense mechanism to avoid possible problems with friends, "give me the computer or i will shutdown it", no you can't would be the answer. "bye bye", and pc shutdown.
BOOM HEADSHOT jaja.
Have fun ;D
